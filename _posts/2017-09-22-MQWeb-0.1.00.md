MQWeb 0.1.00 released
========

##### 22 september 2017

Today MQWeb 0.1.00 is released. You can download this release from
[Github](https://github.com/fbraem/mqweb/releases/tag/v0.1.00).

Less is more ... The web application is moved to a separate repository [MQWebApp](https://github.com/fbraem/mqwebapp). This app will be used as
demo for using MQWeb. MQWeb is the middleware between WebSphere MQ and all
applications that supports HTTP.

[KBC](http://www.kbc.com), the company I work for, encourages the employees to
engage in open source software (MQWeb was the start of this mind change). But
KBC recommends to use the MIT license. That's why the license is changed.
