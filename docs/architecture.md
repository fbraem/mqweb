Architecture
============

This sequence diagram shows how a built-in HTML page is build.

MQWeb uses the HTTPServer class from [POCO](http://www.pocoproject.org).
This class uses request handlers to handle incoming requests. MQWeb has three
handlers.

## StaticRequestHandler

This request handler is called when the URI starts with `static` and is only
used when the built-in HTML pages are used. This handler is responsible for
returning style sheets, images, scripts, ... In other words: it returns static
content.

## DenyRequestHandler

This handler is called when MQWeb detects an incoming request that needs to
be blocked. It will always return 403 Forbidden.

## ControllerRequestHandler

This handler is responsible for creating the controller that handles a request
for a WebSphere MQ object. There are two types of controllers:

+ The [web controller](docs/web.html) is responsible of returning a built-in
HTML page for a WebSphere MQ object. The web controller will be called when the
first part of the URI is `web`.
+ The [api controllers](/api/index.html) are responsible of sending PCF commands
to WebSphere MQ and to return the answer in JSON format. An api controller is
called when the URI begins with `api`.
