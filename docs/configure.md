Configure MQWeb
===============
When MQWeb is launched it will look for a configuration file. The configuration 
file must be located in the same directory as the executable or a parent 
directory of it, and must have the same base name as the executable, with one 
of the following extensions: *.properties*, *.ini* or *.xml*. The *.properties* 
file, if it exists, is loaded first, followed by the *.ini* file and the *.xml* 
file. If the MQWeb is built in debug mode (the _DEBUG preprocessor macro is 
defined) and the base name of the appication executable ends with a 'd', a 
config file without the 'd' ending its base name is also found. For example: 
"MQWebd.exe", built in debug mode, then MQWeb will automatically find a 
configuration file named *MQWeb.properties* if it exists and if 
*MQWebd.properties* cannot be found.

> Note that the working directory for an application running as a service is 
> the Windows system directory (e.g., C:\Windows\system32).

SQLite Database
---------------
MQWeb uses a SQLite database that defines all WebSphere MQ attributes.
Download the database [here](http://mqweb.org/files/mqweb.db). 
Put this file somewhere and set the `mq.web.db` property in the configuration file. 
If you placed the database in the application folder, you can use this to 
configure it:

    mq.web.db=${application.dir}/mqweb.db
    
Connection Mode
---------------
By default mqweb connects in bindings mode. This can be changed by setting the 
mq.mode property to 'client' and to configure Websphere MQ client or mqweb.

    mq.mode=client 

A connection in client mode can be done in two different ways: configuring
WebSphere MQ client or adding connection configurations in the configuration 
file:

###Option 1: Configure Websphere MQ Client
To connect to a queuemanager use a client channel definition table and set the 
environment variables `MQCHLLIB` and `MQCHLTAB`, or use `mqclient.ini` and set 
`ChannelDefinitionFile` and `ChannelDefinitionDirectory`.

> On Windows the environment variable `MQCLNTCF` must point to mqclient.ini. 

When only one queuemanager is used `MQSERVER` can be used.

###Option 2: Configure MQWeb
Add mq.web.qmgr properties as follows:

    mq.web.qmgr.<qmgrName>.connection=<host>(<port>)
    mq.web.qmgr.<qmgrName>.channel=<channelName>

Where &lt;qmgrName&gt; is the name of the queuemanager, &lt;host&gt; the server where
the queuemanager is running. &lt;port&gt; is the port of the listener and
&lt;channelName&gt; is the name of the server connection channel. When no channel
property is set, `SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN` will be used as default.

Default Queuemanager
--------------------
When no name is passed in the URL, mqweb will try to connect to the default
queuemanager. In bindings mode this is done by connecting with a blank
queuemanager name. In client mode this can be configured by setting
*mq.web.defaultQmgr* property. When this property doesn't exist, mqweb will 
try to connect with "*" and hopes that a client channel definition table 
is configured.

    mq.web.defaultQmgr=PIGEON

Reply Queue
-----------
To get the replies from the command server, MQWeb needs a queue where the replies
are put. By default a temporary queue based on the model queue 
SYSTEM.DEFAULT.MODEL.QUEUE is used, but this behaviour can be changed by setting 
the mq.web.reply property or the reply property of a queuemanager.

    mq.web.reply=MQWEB.REPLY.Q01

or

    mq.web.qmgr.<qmgr>.reply=MQWEB.REPLY.Q01

When you define your own local reply queue, make sure the queue is shareable and
don't forget to apply security settings.

Connection Pooling
------------------

MQWeb creates a connection pool for each queuemanager.

When a queuemanager is requested from the pool:

If a queuemanager is available from the pool, an queuemanager from the pool is 
removed from the pool and returned. Otherwise, if the peak capacity of the pool 
has not yet been reached, a new queuemanager is created, connected and returned.
If the peak capacity has already been reached, no queuemanager is returned
and a HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR is returned to the client.

When a queuemanager is returned to the pool: If the queuemanager is still 
connected and the number of queuemanagers in the pool is below the capacity, 
the queuemanager is added back to the pool. Otherwise it is disconnected.

Each pool has a timer that checks for unused queuemanagers. When a queuemanager
is idle for some configured time, it will be removed from the pool.

The following properties are available to configure the connection pool:

+ `mq.web.<qmgr>.pool.capacity` or `mq.web.pool.capacity`

  The capacity of the pool. When the pool reaches this size and a queuemanager
  is returned to the pool, the queuemanager will be disconnected.

+ `mq.web.<qmgr>.pool.peakcapacity` or `mq.web.pool.peakcapacity`

  The peak capacity of the pool. As long as the size of the pool is smaller
  then this value, a connection to the queuemanager is created and returned.

+ `mq.web.<qmgr>.pool.idle` or `mq.web.pool.idle` 

  The maximum idle time of the queuemanager. When a queuemanager is unused
  for the given time, it will be disconnected and removed from the pool.

Logging
-------

MQWeb uses 3 loggers: mq for all MQ actions, mq.web for all daemon information and mq.web.access to log all requested URI's.
To configure these loggers look at the documentation of [Poco::Util::LoggingConfigurator](http://pocoproject.org/docs/Poco.Util.LoggingConfigurator.html).
The following example will log everything (trace level) to mqweb.log in the application directory, except for the mq.web.access logger
which will be written to the access.log file in the application directory.

    logging.loggers.root.level=trace
    logging.loggers.root.channel.class=FileChannel
    logging.loggers.root.channel.pattern=%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %N %P-%I %q *** %t
    logging.loggers.root.channel.path=${application.dir}/mqweb.log
    
    logging.loggers.l1.name=mq
    
    logging.loggers.l2.name=mq.web
    
    logging.loggers.l3.name=mq.web.access
    logging.loggers.l3.channel.class=FileChannel
    logging.loggers.l3.channel.pattern=%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S *** %t
    logging.loggers.l3.channel.path=${application.dir}/access.log

Protecting MQWeb
----------------

MQWeb can be configured to allow or deny incoming requests. First the incoming
IP address is checked against all mq.web.allow addresses. Next when the IP
address is allowed, the IP address is checked against all configured mq.web.deny
addresses. When nothing is configured, MQWeb will allow all incoming requests.

This example allows access from IP-addresses starting with 10 or 11. But denies
all IP addresses starting with 10.192.

    mq.web.allow.ip1=10*
    mq.web.allow.ip2=11*
    mq.web.deny.ip1=10\.192*

The value of the property must be a valid regular expression.

Web Pages
---------
When the templates and static files, used to create the internal
web pages, are not located in the same folder as the mqweb application, you need
to configure these paths:

+ mq.web.templates

  This is the folder where the templates are placed.

+ mq.web.static

  This is the folder where the static files (images, html, ...) are placed.

This configuration is not required when the internal web pages are not used.
